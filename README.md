recently designed and developed a modern, responsive website for Bhadauriya Traders, focusing on clean UI, fast performance, and user-friendly navigation.
The site includes service pages, product details, customer reviews, a contact form, and a light/dark theme toggle for a better user experience.

🔧 Technologies Used:

HTML5 – Structure & layout

CSS3 – Responsive design, animations, dark mode

JavaScript – Form handling, theme toggle, mobile navigation

✨ Key Features:

Fully responsive UI

Night mode (dark theme) with localStorage

Contact form with dynamic validation

This project helped me strengthen my web design skills and deliver a practical solution for a real local business.
